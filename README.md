An open, customizable, feature-packed alternative bootstrapper for Roblox.

## What is this?
This is intended to be a seamless replacement for the stock Roblox bootstrapper, working more or less how you'd expect it to, while providing new and useful features.

Please keep in mind that **Bloxstrap is in very early development**, and you'll no doubt encounter some bugs. If you do, or you would like to suggest a feature, please submit an issue!
 
Bloxstrap is only supported for PCs running Windows.
 
## Features
Here's some of the features that Bloxstrap provides over the stock Roblox bootstrapper:

* Support for persistent file modifications (including re-adding the old death sound!)
* Ability to choose where Roblox is installed to 
* Ability to choose which Roblox build channel to download from
* Integration with Discord Rich Presence and [rbxfpsunlocker](https://github.com/axstin/rbxfpsunlocker)
* Custom bootstrapper styles (includes old versions and dark theme)

## Installing
Download the [latest release of Bloxstrap](https://github.com/pizzaboxer/bloxstrap/releases/latest), and run it. Configure your preferences if needed, and install. That's about it!

Bloxstrap requires the [x86 .NET 6 Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-6.0.8-windows-x86-installer). If you don't already have it installed, you'll be prompted to install it when trying to run Bloxstrap.
 
It's not unlikely that Windows Smartscreen will show a popup when you run Bloxstrap for the first time. This happens because it's an unknown program, not because it's actually detected as being malicious. To dismiss it, just click on "More info" and then "Run anyway".

Bloxstrap is added to your Start Menu, where you can change your preferences if needed.

* [Roblox Studio Mod Manager](https://github.com/MaximumADHD/Roblox-Studio-Mod-Manager) by [MaximumADHD](https://www.roblox.com/users/2032622/profile) - some utility code was borrowed to help with Bloxstrap's bootstrapper functionality. They're all under Bloxstrap.Helpers.RSMM, with some having slight modifications. Besides, it's a great project.
