An open, customizable, feature-packed alternative bootstrapper for Roblox.

## What is this?
This is intended to be a seamless replacement for the stock Roblox bootstrapper, working more or less how you'd expect it to, while providing new and useful features.
 
Please keep in mind that **Bloxstrap is in very early development**, and you'll no doubt encounter some bugs. If you do, please submit an issue!
 
As of right now, Bloxstrap is only supported for Windows. Mac support is possible, but I don't currently have a Mac to test this on.
 
## Installing
Download the [latest release of Bloxstrap](https://github.com/pizzaboxer/bloxstrap/releases/latest), and run it. Configure your preferences if needed, and install. That's about it!

Bloxstrap requires the [x86 .NET 6 Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-6.0.8-windows-x86-installer). If you don't already have it installed, you'll be prompted to install it when trying to run Bloxstrap.
 
It's not unlikely that Windows Smartscreen will show a popup when you run Bloxstrap for the first time. This happens because it's an unknown program, not because it's actually detected as being malicious. To dismiss it, just click on "More info" and then "Run anyway".

Bloxstrap is added to your Start Menu, where you can change your preferences if needed.
 
## Features
Here's some of the features that Bloxstrap provides over the stock Roblox bootstrapper:

* You can choose where Roblox should be installed to
* Old death sound can be re-enabled
* Integration with Discord Rich Presence
* Bootstrapper style can emulate older version looks

## Contributions
* [Roblox Studio Mod Manager](https://github.com/MaximumADHD/Roblox-Studio-Mod-Manager) by [MaximumADHD](https://www.roblox.com/users/2032622/profile) - some utility code was borrowed to help with Bloxstrap's bootstrapper functionality. They're all under Bloxstrap.Helpers.RSMM, with some having slight modifications. Besides, it's a great project.
