An open, customizable, feature-packed alternative bootstrapper for Roblox.

## What is this?
This is intended to be a seamless replacement for the stock Roblox bootstrapper, working more or less how you'd expect it to, while providing new and useful features.
 
When you first run it, you'll see the preferences menu. If you want to configure preferences again after you've already installed it, open up Apps and Features, look for Bloxstrap and select Modify.

Please keep in mind that **Bloxstrap is in very early development**, and you'll no doubt encounter some bugs. If you do, please submit an issue!
 
Bloxstrap is only supported for PCs running Windows.
 
## Features
Here's some of the features that Bloxstrap provides over the stock Roblox bootstrapper:

* Old death sound and mouse cursor can be permanently re-enabled
* Lets you choose where to install Roblox to
* Integration with Discord Rich Presence
* Custom bootstrapper styles (includes old versions and dark theme)

## Installing
Download the [latest release of Bloxstrap](https://github.com/pizzaboxer/bloxstrap/releases/latest), and run it. Configure your preferences if needed, and install. That's about it!

Bloxstrap requires the [x86 .NET 6 Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-6.0.8-windows-x86-installer). If you don't already have it installed, you'll be prompted to install it when trying to run Bloxstrap.
 
It's not unlikely that Windows Smartscreen will show a popup when you run Bloxstrap for the first time. This happens because it's an unknown program, not because it's actually detected as being malicious. To dismiss it, just click on "More info" and then "Run anyway".

Bloxstrap is added to your Start Menu, where you can change your preferences if needed.

* [Roblox Studio Mod Manager](https://github.com/MaximumADHD/Roblox-Studio-Mod-Manager) by [MaximumADHD](https://www.roblox.com/users/2032622/profile) - some utility code was borrowed to help with Bloxstrap's bootstrapper functionality. They're all under Bloxstrap.Helpers.RSMM, with some having slight modifications. Besides, it's a great project.
