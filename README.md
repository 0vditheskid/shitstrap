An open, customizable, feature-packed alternative bootstrapper for Roblox.

This a seamless replacement for the stock Roblox bootstrapper, working more or less how you'd expect it to, while providing additional useful features.

If you encounter a bug, or would like to suggest a feature, please submit an issue!
 
Bloxstrap is only supported for PCs running Windows.
 
## Features
Here's some of the features that Bloxstrap provides over the stock Roblox bootstrapper:

* Doesn't force you to launch Roblox in the Desktop App
* Support for persistent file modifications (e.g. re-adding the old death sound)
* Lets you choose where to install Roblox to
* Gives you the ability to opt-in to pre-release testing channels
* Integration with Discord Rich Presence and [rbxfpsunlocker](https://github.com/axstin/rbxfpsunlocker)
* Bootstrapper styling

## Installing
Download the [latest release of Bloxstrap](https://github.com/pizzaboxer/bloxstrap/releases/latest), and run it. Configure your preferences if needed, and install. That's about it!

You will also need the [x86 .NET 6 Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-6.0.8-windows-x86-installer). If you don't already have it installed, you'll be prompted to install it anyway.
 
It's not unlikely that Windows Smartscreen will show a popup when you run Bloxstrap for the first time. This happens because it's an unknown program, not because it's actually detected as being malicious. To dismiss it, just click on "More info" and then "Run anyway".

Once installed, Bloxstrap is added to your Start Menu, where you can change your preferences if needed.

* [Roblox Studio Mod Manager](https://github.com/MaximumADHD/Roblox-Studio-Mod-Manager) by [MaximumADHD](https://www.roblox.com/users/2032622/profile) - some slightly modified utility code was borrowed to help with Bloxstrap's bootstrapper functionality (Bloxstrap.Helpers.RSMM). Besides, it's a great project.
* [skulyire](https://www.roblox.com/users/2485612194/profile) - Making the Bloxstrap logo
* [rbxfpsunlocker](https://github.com/axstin/rbxfpsunlocker) by axstin - Added as a Bloxstrap integration.
